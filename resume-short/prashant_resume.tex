	\begin{cvsection}{Projects}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{KeggyFuzzer: }Building smart fuzzers from parser-combinator input. A top-down fuzzer generator generating and mutating inputs to detect input not accepted by grammar. \textit{C, Ruby}.
                \item \textbf{DARPA RADICS:} Contributing to the active development of the TIGR system, being used in the power grid restoration project. We provide information about potential attacks and provide suggestions for defense mechanisms to grid operators.
			    \item \textbf{Snap-in Conduits: } Dynamically patching legacy devices with vulnerable or outdated binaries. We insert a layer of parser code to prevent input-validation exploitations ranging from buffer-overflows to malformed packets.
				\item \textbf{Cyber-physical attack paths:} We used the alloy model-checker to find attack paths in Internet-of-Things networks. These attack paths are not only in the cyber channels, but also physical attributes of devices influencing other devices. \textit{Alloy Model Checker}.
				\item \textbf{Building LangSec Compliant protocol clients:} We have so far built implementations of the MQTT, XMPP, DNP3 and C37.118 protocols. All of which are used in the Industrial IoT and Smart Grid. Our implementations are presently being used actively in the power grid by several vendors.
                %\item \textbf{Kabali:} Developed a tool to visualize ruby YARV structures, and to  traverse through them step by step by tracing the state of the stack at each move at Dartmouth College. \textit{(Ruby).}
				%\item \textbf{The Guindy Times Website:} Developed the website, Android application and the entire API for my undergraduate college campus newspaper. \textit{(Ruby on Rails, Android, Java, CSS, Javascript, HTML)}
